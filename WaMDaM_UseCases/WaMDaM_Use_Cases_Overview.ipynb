    "This notebook demonstrates example use case analysis to query the Water Management Data Model (WaMDaM) database in SQLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "**WaMDaM** is both an information model and a couple of supporting software ecosystem. WaMDaM tools are designed to organize, identify, and compare multiple [systems water management data](http://docs.wamdam.org/Why_WaMDaM/#what-are-the-water-management-data) in a single database. For more information, see http://wamdam.org/     \n",

    "**The use cases aim** to assist modelers to build water resources models in three activities to 1) search in datasets loaded in a WaMDaM SQLite database instance for input data needed for a model in a study area, 2) analyze and compare data values to use in a model, and 3) identify how the natural and engineered systems are connected and the directions of flow among them.\n",

    "The Notebooks use the Python 2.7 libraries [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [SQLite](http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-python/) and [plotly](https://plot.ly/) that are aready installed on the HydroShare Notebook server.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to use the Notebook**   \n",
    "The Nootebook reads WaMDaM SQLite data from a published HydroShare Generic Resource, runs SQL script for each use case, and then uses plotly to visualize the results. SQL script used here is referenced from the GitHub files to maintain a managable and simple Notebook. However you may place and edit your SQL script within the Notebook as well as shown below. \n",
    "Once you're done with each use case, you may save the use case input SQLite file, the Notebook file, and the results of plots and tabels into a new HydroShare resources of your own. The scripts used in the use cases here is available at http://docs.wamdam.org/UseCases/Application/\n",

Modelers often use many data management methods to query, manipulate, and join different water management data types (e.g., time series, multi-column arrays) to analyze and prepare them for systems models. \n",

    "Modelers may search for attributes with numeric and descriptive values to correctly understand and represent the functions of water systems like modeling hydropower in Reservoirs. In this case, we use the controlled Instances of Shasta Reservoir, California and Flaming Gorge Reservoir, Utah to identify and compare and relate their dam heights, installed hydropower capacity, and number of generators across both the US Dams and the National Hydropower Datasets (Table 5). With a 100 feet higher dam and four more installed generators, the Shasta Reservoir has a hydropower capacity at about five times of the Flaming Gorge Reservoir. "

    "<a name=\"Use Case 3\"></a>\n",
    "Besides identifying data values that describe water systems components, researchers need to identify how water supply, demand, and other system components are connected to correctly represent them in models. This use case employs the features of controlled vocabularies and the connectivity of nodes and links through networks to enable a more readily and consistent method to search for water system components and their connectivity across datasets. WaMDaM uses the Connections table to search for all links where a provided node is a start (outflow) or end (inflow) to links. For example, what links flow into or out of Hyrum Reservoir in three model scenarios in the Little Bear River Utah? We draw a schematic for each one, which visually reveals similarities and differences among the networks (Figure 9). "
